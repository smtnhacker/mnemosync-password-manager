A Password manager that uses spaced repetition to help users remember their passwords even after D-Day.

_Note: Might not help for systems that uses stuff like  2FA._

### Some Introduction

This was made for a PERN workshop, at work. This is still far from working, but to be honest, I'm not sure if its being done right. In particular, for a password manager, its security is _still_ horrible (does not even encrypt passwords yet).

### TO-DO

Here are some pretty _urgent_ to-do's that I still plan to work on (before putting the project back to the closet). Yeah, this thing is in its very early phases.

- [/] Encrypt the passwords client-side

- [X] ~~Use (or remove) the handshake~~ _Just use HTTPS_

- [ ] Perform bare minimum input validations

- [ ] Make the UI responsive

- [/] Actually add the SRS algorithm

- [ ] Add some tests (maybe?)

### Contribution

Since this is a practice project, I _might_ accept criticisms. But since this is **just** a practice project, I might not continue working on this so to save you the trouble, I won't be accepting contributions.
